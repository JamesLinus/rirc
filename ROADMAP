TODO (in no particular order):
---------------------------

^F as find channel

^C as cancel current line/action

/IGNORE [nick]
/UNIGNORE
	can be implemented as a single nicklist per server

/TOPIC [message]
	set/get channel topic

/HELP [type]
	show available commands.
	if [type] is given, show more specific help

/CLEAR
	equivalent to ^L for clearing channel

/NICKS
	print the current nicks to the channel

/NOTICE

CTCP (at a minimum):
	CLIENTINFO, TIME, PING

Channel buffer scrollback. Probably requires rewrite of buffer
drawing logic.

Input tab complete.
	For commands if input[0] == '/'
	For nicks (in order of last spoken in channel?)

A whole bunch of numeric replies. Implementing them as I encounter them.

Make sure all the thread related code is using thread-safe functions,
and that proper cancellation points are used. Make sure no resources
can be left hanging (eg: sockets left open when a thread is canceled?)

Reconnection routine for non-explicit disconnect. Exponential backoff
for repeated attempts, with some maximum number of tries.

A configuration file and parser

Investigate SIGIO as alternative to server socket polling loop

Parsing 004/005 numeric for server specific configuration

buffer logging

Nickserv stuff

Implement flag handling in send_* commands for finer control
eg:
/topic                                    = TOPIC #this_channel
/topic setting a topic                    = TOPIC #this_channel :setting a topic
/topic -unset                             = TOPIC #this_channel :
/topic -channel #other                    = TOPIC #other_channel
/topic -channel #other setting a topic    = TOPIC #other_channel :setting a topic
/topic -unset #other                      = TOPIC #other_channel :


FIXME:
---------------------------
when erroneous nickname on connect (eg too long) goes into infinite loop
for some reason

numeric 004, the trailing is null on some servers... is it null on freenode?
	<server info> ~ (null)    as oppose to   "is supported by this server"
	maybe a blanket thing that checks if trailing is null and doesnt print it

emotes are being received as privmesgs and opening their own channel lol

channel name case issues. eg: /join #aBc. Replies refer to #abc


MAYBE (Probably never):
---------------------------
For input pastes that exceed some defined limit, offer a third option:
	post to, for example, pastebin, and send the url to channel

Client/daemon mode:
	with -d, --daemon mode, rirc stays open in the background
	when the user closes the client. draw()s are ignored, etc.
	when a client connects to the daemon, send SIGWINCH, open pipes, etc
